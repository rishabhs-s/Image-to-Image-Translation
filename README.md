# Image-to-Image-Translation Using GANs
#
#Purpose
The purpose of the project is to implement a semantic image-to-image translation using Generative Adversarial Networks and Autoencoders to elucidate on unsupervised machine learning. The intent is to develop a GANs based model to create new novel images from existing image input.

## Sub Purpose
Create Autoencoder model to condense feature selection on Image dataset.<br>
Formulate a GAN to perform image to Image translation.<br>
Create a Pix2Pix Model to train and deploy the conditional generative adversarial network.<br>
#

## Target Beneficiary
The target audience for this Deep Learning project is a user who wants to design new shoes designs from the earlier existing data .Other uses of the model are listed below:<br>
To provide help to designers for designing Provide users or their clients with diverse ideas.<br>
To create new images form one reference.<br>
The uses and possibilities are endless. Use of the model depends on the userâ€™s perspective and creative intellect.<br>
